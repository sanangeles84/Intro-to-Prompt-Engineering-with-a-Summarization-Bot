 The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the primary federal entity for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data related to education in the United States and other nations. This report, the 2022 edition of the Condition of Education, is an annual report mandated by the U.S. Congress that summarizes the latest data on education in the United States. It uses data from across the center and from other sources and is designed to help policymakers and the public monitor the condition and progression of education in the United States. This report includes fifty-two indicators that provide detailed information on a unique topic, ranging from



The Report on the Condition of Education 2022 presents an overview of findings across topics related to prekindergarten through postsecondary education, labor force outcomes, and international comparisons. This year, interactive figures are being rolled out to empower users to explore the data in different ways. Enrollment rates for young children decreased by 6 percentage points for 5-year-olds and 13 percentage points for 3- to 4-year-olds from 2019 to 2020. Public school enrollment in prekindergarten through grade 12 dropped 3 percent from 2019 to 2020, erasing a decade of steady growth.



In the fall of 2021, 44 percent of postsecondary institutions reported no change in plans for any household members, compared to 28 percent in the fall of 2020. The Condition of Education report from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) includes an At a Glance section, Reader's Guide, Glossary, and Guide to Sources to provide additional context. Data sources include the Department of Education, U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and international data collection efforts. In 2020-21, among adults with children under 18, 5 percent reported having at least one child



Enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools has increased from 2009 to 2020, with the majority of students attending traditional schools. In 2020, the percentage of students enrolled in public schools by race/ethnicity was: White (50.2%), Hispanic (25.7%), Black (15.2%), Asian (5.2%), and Native American (1.3%). Additionally, 13.3% of students were served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In 2019, the percentage of public school students who were English learners (ELs) varied by state. In

 The Report on the Condition of Education 2022 provides key findings from the Condition of Education Indicator System. It includes 88 indicators, including 23 on crime and safety topics. The emergence of the coronavirus pandemic brought major disruptions to all levels of education, with school enrollment rates for 3- to 4-year-olds falling 13 percentage points to 40 percent and enrollment rates for 5-year-olds falling 6 percentage points to 84 percent. Public school enrollment dropped from 50.8 million to 49.4 million students, erasing a decade of steady growth. At the postsecondary level, undergraduate enrollment



The Coronavirus Pandemic has had a significant impact on postsecondary education plans for the fall of 2021, with 32% of adults in households with prospective postsecondary students reporting changes to the format of instruction (e.g. from in-person to online). Additionally, 16% reported that all plans to take classes in the fall had been canceled for at least one household member, and 12% reported that at least one household member would take fewer classes in the fall. In public elementary and secondary schools (preK through grade 12) in fall 2020, 22.6 million students



Scores for this age group declined between assessments, but course completion was higher in 2019 than in 2009 for algebra II, precalculus/mathematical analysis, and courses in biology, chemistry, and physics. However, the percentage of graduates who had completed calculus was lower in 2019 than in 2009. The U.S. average adjusted cohort graduation rate for public high school students was 86 percent in 2018-19, the highest rate since 2010-11. In 2020, there were 2.0 million status dropouts between the ages of 16 and 24, and the overall status dropout



In 2020–21, 6.8 percent of adults 18 years and older reported having at least one child homeschooled in their household, according to the Household Pulse Survey (HPS). This percentage varied by race/ethnicity, with 8 percent of White adults, 5.1 percent of Black adults, 3.6 percent of Asian adults, and 6.5 percent of Hispanic adults reporting homeschooling. Other racial/ethnic groups reported a higher percentage of 10.6 percent. The percentage of adults reporting homeschooling also varied by household income and the number of children in the



The U.S. Department of Commerce, Census Bureau, Household Pulse Survey found that 7.4% of adults 18 years old and over who had children under 18 in the home reported having at least one child homeschooled in 2020-21. The survey also revealed that 44% of adults reported that there was no change for any household member in their fall 2021 plans for postsecondary classes, compared with 28% who reported no change to fall 2020 plans. Despite this improvement, 32% reported that the classes that at least one household member planned to take would be taught in different formats in



The 2021 Household Pulse Survey found that 38 percent of adults 18 years old and over who reported that household members planned to take classes in fall 2021 from a postsecondary institution had their plans cancelled due to the coronavirus or concerns about getting the virus. Other reasons for cancellation included uncertainty about how classes/programs might change (28 percent), the institution’s changes in the content or format of classes (20 percent), changes to financial aid (20 percent), caring for others whose care arrangements had been disrupted (12 percent), changes to campus life (10 percent), and caring for someone

 Burchinal et al. (2010) studied the effects of early educational intervention, early cumulative risk, and the early home environment on young adult outcomes in a high-risk sample. Ross et al. (2012) found that in 2021, 16% of children under 18 lived in poverty, 8% lived in households where no parent had completed high school, and 71% lived in two-parent households. Black children were more likely to live in female parent-only households (50%) than two-parent households (42%). These findings suggest that early educational intervention, early cumulative risk, and the



In 2020, 55% of 3-5 year olds were enrolled in school, with 84% of 5 year olds and 40% of 3-4 year olds enrolled. This was lower than in 2019, prior to the coronavirus pandemic, with 6 percentage points lower for 5 year olds and 13 percentage points lower for 3-4 year olds. Enrollment rates varied by parents' educational attainment, employment status, and family income. For example, enrollment rates were higher for 3-4 year olds whose parents had an associate's degree or higher than those whose parents had a high school



Between 2009 and 2020, total public elementary and secondary school enrollment dropped from 50.8 million to 49.4 million students, the largest single year decline since 1943. This 3 percent drop was concentrated among students in preK through 8th grade, with enrollment in those grades dropping from 34.4 million to 34.1 million. In contrast, enrollment in grades 9 through 12 increased from 15.0 million to 15.3 million. Public charter school enrollment more than doubled over this period, from 1.6 million to 3.4 million students, while traditional public school enrollment decreased by 0



Private school enrollment in kindergarten through grade 12 has remained relatively stable since 2009, making up around 9% of the combined public and private enrollment in the same period. In fall 2020, 46% of students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools were White, 15% were Black, 28% were Hispanic, 5% were Asian, 1% were American Indian/Alaska Native, and 5% were of Two or more races. Pacific Islander students made up less than one half of 1% of public elementary and secondary enrollment. These figures reflect a decrease in White and Black student enrollment, and



Public schools in the US have seen an increase in the number of students served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) from 6.5 million in 2009-10 to 7.2 million in 2020-21.

The percentage of ELs was 10.0 percent or more in 12 states and the District of Columbia, with the highest concentrations in the West. About 3.9 million Hispanic EL public school students constituted 76.8 percent of EL student enrollment overall, followed by Asian students (10.2 percent), White students (6.5 percent), and 221,000 students from other racial/ethnic groups. Language assistance programs can help

 In 2019, 95% of 3- to 18-year-olds had home internet access, with the highest percentage (99%) belonging to those whose parents had attained a bachelor's or higher degree. The percentages of 3- to 18-year-olds with home internet access varied across racial/ethnic groups, with the highest percentage (99%) belonging to those who were Asian and the lowest (83%) belonging to those who were American Indian/Alaska Native. Black EL students made up 4.3% of the total EL student enrollment, while Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaska Natives



In 2017-18, there were 3.5 million full- and part-time public school teachers in the US, including 1.8 million elementary school teachers and 1.8 million secondary school teachers. Most of these teachers held a regular or standard state teaching certificate or advanced professional certificate (90%), while 4% held a provisional or temporary certificate, 3% held a probationary certificate, 2% held no certification, and 1% held a waiver or emergency certificate. The majority of public school teachers were White (79%) and female (76%), and the average base salary for full-



Since the 1970s, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has been measuring the reading and mathematics achievement of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds enrolled in public and private schools. Results from 2020 show improvement in reading and mathematics achievement at ages 9 and 13 since the 1970s. However, average scores for 9-year-olds were not measurably different in 2020 compared to 2012, and average scores for 13-year-olds were lower in 2020 than in 2012 for both subjects. Additionally, NAEP also assesses student performance in science at grades 4,



In 2019, 36% of 4th-grade students, 35% of 8th-grade students, and 22% of 12th-grade students performed at or above the NAEP Proficient level in the NAEP Science Assessments. This was higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2015 for 4th-grade students. The Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate (ACGR) for public high school students in the US increased from 79% in 2010-11 to 86% in 2018-19. The ACGR for American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic



In 2019, high school graduates from private schools had higher completion rates in more advanced mathematics and science courses than their peers from traditional public and public charter schools. This report examines the cohort of first-time 9th-graders in a particular school year, adjusted by adding any students who immigrate from another country or transfer into the cohort after 9th grade and subtracting any students who transfer out, emigrate to another country, or die. The percentage of graduates who had completed algebra II, precalculus/mathematical analysis, and courses in all three subjects of biology, chemistry



In 2020, there were 2.0 million status dropouts between the ages of 16 and 24, and the overall status dropout rate was 5.3 percent. This rate decreased from 7.4 percent in 2010, with the largest decrease seen among Hispanic and Black 16- to 24-year-olds. In 2018-19, elementary and secondary public school revenues totaled $795 billion in constant 2020-21 dollars, with 8 percent from federal sources, 47 percent from state sources, and 45 percent from local sources. Additionally, 24 percent of private school graduates had completed calculus, compared with



The United States public elementary and secondary school system spent $800 billion in 2018-19, amounting to $15,621 per public school pupil enrolled in the fall of that year. This includes $13,701 per pupil on current expenditures, $1,499 per pupil on capital outlay, and $420 per pupil on interest on school debt. Postsecondary education is not mandatory, but enrollment rates and attendance status are assessed overall and by student characteristics. Different contexts offer students different resources, such as programs, faculty and staff, and financial aid. Outcomes such as persistence,



In October 2020, 63 percent of the 3.1 million high school completers enrolled in college, a rate known as the immediate college enrollment rate. This rate was lower than the rate in 2010 (68 percent). The rate for Asian students (86 percent) was higher than the rates for White (67 percent), Hispanic (60 percent), and Black (54 percent) students. Between fall 2009 and fall 2020, total undergraduate enrollment decreased by 9 percent (from 17.5 million to 15.9 million students). The rate for 4-year institutions in 2020 (43 percent) was not

The overall 6-year graduation rate for first-time, full-time undergraduate students who began seeking a bachelor's degree at 4-year degree-granting institutions in fall 2014 was 64%. The 6-year graduation



In 2019-20, the average net price of attendance for first-time, full-time undergraduate students attending 4-year institutions was $14,200 at public institutions, $28,100 at private nonprofit institutions, and $23,200 at private for-profit institutions (in constant 2020–21 dollars). The majority of students at 4-year institutions were awarded financial aid in the form of federal grants (69 percent) and student loans (68 percent). Total revenues at degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the United States were $695 billion (in constant 2020–21 dollars



In 2019-20, degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the United States spent $671 billion (in constant 2020-21 dollars). Private for-profit institutions generated the largest primary source of revenue (93%), while private nonprofit institutions generated 36% from all other sources and 34% from student tuition and fees. Instruction expenses per full-time-equivalent (FTE) student was the largest expense category at public institutions ($11,270, or 27%) and private nonprofit institutions ($19,570, or 30%). At private for-profit institutions, the combined category of academic support



In March 2021, the employment rate of 25- to 34-year-olds was higher for those with higher levels of educational attainment. The employment rate ranged from 53 percent for those who had not completed high school to 86 percent for those with a bachelor’s or higher degree. Overall, the employment rate for 25- to 34-year-olds increased from 2010 to 2021, with the highest rate of 86 percent for those with a bachelor’s or higher degree. Caution should be used when comparing 2021 estimates to those of prior years due to the impact that the coronav



Employment rates in 2021 were not significantly different from those in 2010. However, those with some college or high school education saw a decrease in employment rates from 2019 to 2021. Those without a high school degree had similar employment rates in 2021 and 2010. Those with higher educational attainment had higher median earnings in 2020 than those with lower educational attainment. The U.S. scored in the top 25% of participating education systems in both mathematics and science at 4th and 8th grade levels in 2019. In 2020, the U.S. was among the top 6 out of 34 countries in terms

 This report examines the scores of 8th-grade students on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) mathematics scale. The TIMSS scale is the same in each administration, with a centerpoint of 500 and a standard deviation of 100, meaning a value of 500 in 2019 is equal to 500 in 1995. The figure shows the scores for the 10th and 90th percentile, which are specific to each education system's distribution of scores. The 90th to 10th percentile score gap is compared to the U.S. score gap, with some education systems having a higher gap



In 2020, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that 92% of 25- to 64-year-olds in the United States had a high school diploma or its equivalent, compared to an average of 80% for all OECD member countries. Among the 34 countries for which the OECD reported 2020 data on high school completion rates, the percentages of 25- to 64-year-olds who had completed high school ranged from 42% in Mexico to 90% or more in nine countries. Additionally, 50% of 25- to 64-year-olds in the United States



In 2020, the OECD reported that among the 34 countries surveyed, the percentage of 25-34 year olds with any postsecondary degree ranged from 19% in Mexico to 60% in Canada. 18 countries, including the United States, reported that 40% or more of this age group had obtained a postsecondary degree, compared to the OECD average of 39%. Between 2010 and 2020, the OECD average percentage of those with any postsecondary degree rose from 37% to 46%, while the corresponding percentage in the United States rose from 42% to 52%. In addition, the OECD average percentage of those
